API Communication

The client and server communicate through API endpoints.

Example:

Client
  │
  │ HTTP Request
  ▼
Server API
  │
  ├── Database
  ├── Payment Gateway
  └── Email Service
  │
  ▼
Response
  │
  ▼
Client

The API base URL should be stored in environment variables and should not be hardcoded throughout the application.

Example:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

The actual environment variables and API URL will depend on the backend configuration.

Environment Variables

Do not commit secret credentials to GitHub.

Examples of sensitive configuration include:

DATABASE_URL=
JWT_SECRET=
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=

Use .env / .env.local files locally and ensure they are included in .gitignore.

Local Development
Clone the Repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd NICEMAN-AGRO
Client
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
Server

Open another terminal:

cd server
npm install
npm run dev

The client and server should run independently during development.

Git Workflow

Both developers should work using separate branches.

Example:

git checkout -b feature/product-page

or:

git checkout -b feature/product-api

After completing a feature:

git add .
git commit -m "Add product API"
git push -u origin feature/product-api

Create a Pull Request when the work is ready for review.

Important

Do not commit:

node_modules/
.env
.env.local
*.env

Do not commit API keys, database credentials, passwords, or other secrets.

Development Principles

Both client and server developers should:

Keep client and server responsibilities separate
Avoid unnecessary changes to another developer's work
Use clear and descriptive commit messages
Create feature branches
Test changes before pushing
Avoid committing secrets
Keep reusable code organized
Communicate API changes between client and server developers
Avoid breaking existing functionality when adding new features
Project Goal

The goal is to build a reliable, professional and user-friendly agricultural e-commerce platform that allows customers to easily discover agricultural products, learn about farming, place orders and complete purchases online.

The client and server applications should work together through clearly defined APIs while remaining independently maintainable.
